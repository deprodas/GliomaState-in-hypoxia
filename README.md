## Understanding hypoxia-associated transcriptional plasticity in low-grade gliomas 

This repository contains analysis scripts and computational workflows associated with a research project investigating hypoxia-associated transcriptional programs in low-grade brain tumors. The study identifies and characterizes distinct glioma cell subpopulations, delineates their functional states, and examines the role of the tumor microenvironment, particularly microglia-derived signals, in modulating cellular plasticity.
